🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN (PyTorch & TensorFlow)

This project demonstrates how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work by training models on the MNIST dataset using both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and then deploying them in real-time using a webcam to recognize handwritten digits.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the working of CNNs by:

Training deep learning models on the MNIST dataset (digits 0–9).

Comparing PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations.

Running real-time inference using your webcam — draw a digit on paper, show it to the camera, and the model predicts it instantly!
